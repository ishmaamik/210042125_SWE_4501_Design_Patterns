A design pattern that helps you separate the creation code from the main code, see with an example:

Suppose an airport ticket center. I am giving the route I want to go to, suppose Palestine to Bangladesh,
now I don't know which plane does that and I don't even have to worry about that because,
the ticket center will manage the plane according to the plane routes. 
I say "Palestine-to-Bangladesh" I'm given Crescent Airlines that travels from Bangladesh Palestine vice versa. 
The ticket finding and creating is done by the factory class. Whereas the main code which includes ordering the ticket and getting the 
destination does not involve any mention of how the ticket was created, does it? No, rather we ordered and they gave after creating from
somewhere else- the factory class!
