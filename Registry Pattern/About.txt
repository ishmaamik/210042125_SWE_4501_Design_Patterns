Basic Factory Pattern involves OCP violation in the factory class, the if-else thingy, so registry pattern improves this place.
Instead of one factory class, we create factory classes for different types of the same thing e.g. shape, ticket. Then we register the 
factories against the shape/ticket classes via a HashMap or any map (Linked HashMap, TreeMap). Then I also tried configuring those registries 
separately via FactoryConfig class so that we don't need to implement the registry inside the main class.
